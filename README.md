# Calculator

## Description

This is my first JavaScript calculator project. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations and includes a display for results.

## Project Overview

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) curriculum, aimed at building foundational JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills through a practical, hands-on calculator application.

  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
  - Percentage calculation
- Clear and reset functions

# My process

## Built with

    - HTML5 - Semantic markup for structure
    - CSS - Custom properties, responsive design with Flexbox
    - JavaScript - Handles calculator logic and updates to the display

## What I learned

This project helped reinforce my understanding of:

- JavaScript functions, event handling, and DOM manipulation
- CSS styling and Flexbox for layout management
- Debugging and troubleshooting JavaScript code

# Challenges and Improvements

- Implementing advanced operations
- Refining the user interface for a more polished design
- Improving error handling for edge cases, such as division by zero

# Future Enhancements

- Memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC)
- Scientific functions (e.g., square root, exponent)
- Keyboard input support for a better user experience

# Useful resources
